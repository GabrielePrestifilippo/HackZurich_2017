It is acknowledged that a diet cannot simply be delivered to the patient in a one-size-fits-all approach.
HealthEat is a mobile app that approaches the problem by providing personalized dietary recommendations with an objective to satisfy the daily nutritian consumption proportions.
The objective function is designed provide 45-50% of calories from CHO, 20% protein and about 30% fat, as specified in the reference work of Gray et. al.
Given that you ate food A for the breakfast and food B for the lunch, HeathEat recommends you 5 foods to satisfy your overall daily nutritian consumption portions.
